# MoodMender- Your Paris Syndrome AI Psychologist


Paris Syndrome is a psychological condition primarily affecting Japanese tourists who experience extreme culture shock when visiting Paris. The syndrome manifests through symptoms such as acute delusional states, hallucinations, feelings of persecution, derealization, depersonalization, anxiety, dizziness, tachycardia, and sweating. The condition is often triggered by the stark contrast between the romanticized image of Paris and the reality of the city, which can be overwhelming for some visitors. Factors such as language barriers, exhaustion, and cultural differences exacerbate the condition.
